# Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease in patients using logistic regression, based on the Framingham Heart Study dataset.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing
- Logistic Regression model
- Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report)

## Setup
1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the script:
```
python heart_disease_prediction.py
```

The script will load the dataset, perform EDA, train the model, and print evaluation metrics.
